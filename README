Push Mobile Engine is a fast and lightweigth tool to send notification to iOS or Andro√Ød platforms through an asynchronous queue.
It is based on beanstalkd : http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/




===========================
Current status :

Testing, only APNS is working for now.



============================
How it works :

Simply consume a Beanstalk queue (produced by PHP, Ruby, Java... see beanstalkd page) and send it to Apple Notification Server or C2DM.

Example :

Assuming you have a beanstalk engine running on localhost, 

Produce a message in PHP :

<?


require_once('libs/pheanstalk_init.php');

$pheanstalk = new Pheanstalk('127.0.0.1');

$Message[] = "xxxxxxxDEVICExxxxxxxTOKENxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
$Message[] = "Notification from Push Mobile Engine";


        $pheanstalk
	        ->useTube('myAppTube')
	        ->put(json_encode($apnsMessage));
	
?>

And that's it ! Simple is beautifull.

Now lets look at our consumer :

We need a configuration (in this example, call it pme-myApp.ini) file containing this :

[server]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 11600
tube = myAppTube

[APNS]
dev-mode = 0 ;choose 1 for sandbox
rsa_key= /usr/local/etc/apns/foot/apn-dev-key.pem
rsa_cert = /usr/local/etc/apns/foot/apn-dev-cert.pem


[C2DM]
mode = production ;choose this or "development"
C2DM-user=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
C2DM-pass=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
C2DM-registration-id=your_registration


You are now ready, you can produce as many consumer as you want, and lauch it this way :

pmengine </path/to/your/pme-myApp.ini>


================================
INSTALLATION

OK I want it and I want it NOW !
Cool, here is what you need :

A beanstakd server that you can get here : http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/
A job producer : You will find Java, Perl, Python, ... , and even .NET client here : https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/wiki/client-libraries

The C librairy to compile our pmEngine : http://github.com/bergundy/libbeanstalkclient/

Then edit our Makefile to fit your environment, then type 

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

...and that should rock.
